- ✌️ Hi, I’m Ben! I am 26 years old and currently working in [imec Leuven](https://www.imec-int.com/en) as a **Instrumentation Engineer - Life Sciences Applications**. On a daily basis I am occupied with hard- and software development, experimental work, data analysis and more. I have worked on various projects ranging from image analysis pipelines, automated microscope measurements, *in-situ* monitoring of a microfluidic DNA synthesizer to automated HTML and PDF report generation...
- 🎓 I have an educational background in both **biochemistry and nano-engineering**, both from KU Leuven.
- 👨‍💻 My favorite programming language will forever be **Python**, but I am currently in the process of learning **Rust** using the amazing [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). My goal is to start applying this professionally as well in the context of [embedded development](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/), asynchronous programming and more. Basically, it's the perfect complement to Python!
- 🔬 Whenever I feel like being productive in my free time, I try to spend some time on data analysis, statistics, scientific computing and simple games. Check out my repositories to see **my projects**!
- 🐍 I’m currently learning the **basics of machine learning** with Python's TensorFlow library at the wonderful [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) in order to finish up their complete Python curriculum found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) and [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).
- 📫 You can always **reach out to me** on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-de-jonge/)!
