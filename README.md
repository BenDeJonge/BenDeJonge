- ✌️ Hi, I’m Ben! I am 25 years old and currently working in [imec Leuven](https://www.imec-int.com/en) as a Researcher on a RNA synthesis project for a big pharma client. On a daily basis I am occupied with experimental work, data analysis and even hard- and software development.
- 🎓 I have an educational background in biochemistry and nano-engineering, both from KU Leuven.
- 🔬 Lately, I have become more and more interested in Python programming, specifically for data analysis, scientific computing and simple games. Check out my repositories to see my projects!
- 🐍 I’m currently learning the basics of machine learning with Python's TensorFlow at the wonderful [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) in order to finish up their complete Python curriculum found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) and [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).
- 📫 You can always reach out to me on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-de-jonge/)!
