- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BenDeJonge! I am 25 years old and currently working in [imec Leuven](https://www.imec-int.com/en) as a Researcher on a RNA synthesis project for a big pharma client. On a daily basis I am occupied with experimental work, data analysis and even hard- and software development.
- ðŸ‘€ Lately, I have become more and more interested in Python programming, specifically for data analysis, scientific computing and simple games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of machine learning with the wonderful folks at [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/) in order to finish up their complete Python curriculum [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) and [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).
- ðŸ“« You can always reach out to me on my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-de-jonge/)!
